# Tempest Hikes

##Tempest Hikes is a [CouchDB] (http://couchdb.apache.org/) based content management system for storing hiking information.

On the admin side, it allows you to add and update information about hikes, including:
* Hike Name
* Area
* The type of hike
* Date most recently hiked
* Distance
* Elevation gain
* A description
* Driving directions
* Images

On the user side, hikes are displayed as points on a map and as a feed of the most recent ones in reverse chronological order.  When a hike is selected, all of the information mentioned above is displayed.  Additionally, a 10 day weather forecast from [Weather Underground] (http://www.wunderground.com/) is provided with the hike information.
